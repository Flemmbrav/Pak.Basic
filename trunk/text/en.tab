AT-AT\n\nThe All Terrain Armored Transport is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Imperial ground forces. Standing over 20 meters tall with blast-impervious armour plating, these massive constructs are used as much for psychological effect as they are for tactical advantage. In this case though, it's just a statue to celebrate Star Wars Day. May the Fourth be with you!
mon_brose
Monument to Alexander Brose\n\nAlex. Brose is a world-class pixel artist, who left his mark not only in P192C. The monument shows one of the building-breeders, a machine which grows stray pixels into magnificent skyscrapers. Sadly, only Mr. Brose can operate it.
mon_coot
Cornelius Coot\n\nThe oversized statue was founded in 1952 to honor the cities founder, Cornelius Coot. It was financed by the richest inhabitant, who aimed to trump the Maharaja of Howdoyustans slightly smaller statue. The prominently placed corn reminds us of their important part in victory over spanish invaders.\n The duck was a misunderstanding. The sculptor Carl Barks and his assistent Don Rosa were only told to "Show Coot costumed as a pioneer holding cobs of corn", no further instructions or feedback.
mon_creeper

Unfortunatly the speed control is rusted, so a countermoving platform was buildt to keep this 'BR 61', a locomotive of the Henschel-Wegmann-Train, in place.
